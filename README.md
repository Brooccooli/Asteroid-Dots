# Asteroid-Dots
This project is data oriented because it uses ECS through the DOTS system. The program works through initiating objects, that are data components places onto prefabs, to a sub-scene by a system then other systems controls these objects, not through replicating the system but by accessing the systems placed on the objects, e.g. The objects have a velocity component on them which is only a three dimensional vector, the thing that moves them is a seperate system that runs in the scene and not on the object.

Build is Windows.rar/Asteroid dots game.exe
